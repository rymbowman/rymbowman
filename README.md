- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Ryan Bowman.

I have recently chosen to move out of a career in teaching that I have had over the past 5 years to explore a career change into the software development field. I am currently learning the basics of coding through the Odin Project and am working on a couple of projects on the side to build my skills in web development.
